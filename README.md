## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML
- CSS media queries
- Flexbox
- Javascript events

### What I learned

I learned about: using the menu element for lists of interactive items, using the viewport height/width units for responsive design, using the object-fit property for making images the proper size in their container, the aspect-ratio property, and the first-of-type pseudo-class.

### Continued development

I would like to improve my skills at creating responsive designs.
